// Workflow Controls - Extracted from ChatUIManager for Phase 3 Architectural Refactoring
//
// Handles workflow execution control, progress management, and UI event handling.
// Separated from ChatUIManager to reduce coupling and improve maintainability.
//
// NOTE: The WorkflowControlsManager class is now defined in workflow_controls_manager.js
// This file has been cleaned up to remove duplicate functionality.
//
// All workflow control logic is now centralized in workflow_controls_manager.js
