"""
Frontend Modules Directory - Phase 5.6D

Contains modularized JavaScript components for the frontend.
Separated from monolithic script.js for better maintainability.

Modules:
- main-ui-manager.js: Handles view management, theme system, and status bar
- chat-ui-manager.js: Manages chat functionality, messages, and typing indicators
- workflow-manager.js: Handles workflow selection, loading, and session management
- artifact-display-manager.js: Provides rich UI for displaying workflow artifacts
- session-recovery.js: Manages cross-session persistence and recovery

Legacy files still maintained:
- ../config_ui.js: System configuration interface
- ../chat_history_manager.js: Chat history functionality
- ../chat_ui_enhancements.js: Additional UI enhancements

# This is primarily for documentation purposes as JS modules don't use Python imports
# The modules are loaded via <script> tags in index.html
